The Plan:

Bringing gSchool alumni, developers, and designers together for two days of hands on code & design talks alongside hackathons, picnics, happy hours, and game-like competitions. Networking with alumni from all over the country. Promoting (what is it promoting?)

Galvanize has always been about networking to promote a healthy and productive tech world and having those special interactions with designers & developers over good food and good drink.


A Celebration:

Geared toward reconnecting Galvanize alumni, instructors, and support staff for an annual two-day extravaganza! Join us for a weekend of tech talks, activities, food, laughter, and possibly even a hackathon, while reconnecting with friends, engaging with our dynamic network of blossoming and seasoned professionals, and of course, celebrating the wondrous experience that first brought us all together.

gDay is more than a reunion. It’s a place to learn and grow professionally, make new friends and have a great time. It can be a starting place for great debates on technology and philosophy around creating things for our digital world. 

Bringing together developers, designers, data scientists, and strategists. 

New Inspiration for Everyone:

This alumni day exists to inspire and build community. It also has an ability to introduce alumni to new concepts, languages, & frameworks. 

Topics ranging from dev ops, frontend, backend, UX, strategy and more. Talks are submitted by speakers and voted on by the community.

If you’re interested in submitting a talk, the call for speakers is out right now! Submit your talk today!


A GATHERING.

At the core, gDay is all about the community. It’s about bringing people together from different disciplines to share tricks and create friendships. It’s about having a good time with others in the industry in an informal setting that encourages the sharing of ideas. 

Let's get together August 2019!

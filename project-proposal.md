# Group Project Proposal:
gDay : Galvanize Alumni Day

## Group Members:
Clark Newell, James Truitt, Job Smith, Ryan Hackemer, Savannah Adams

## Project Description:

The Alumni gDay app is a dynamic, single-page web application geared towards the purpose of reconnecting Galvanize alumni, instructors, and support staff for an annual one-day extravaganza. Our goal is to gather the support and interest in curating a day of tech talks, activities, food, and laughter, while facilitating the opportunity to: reconnect with friends, re-engage with our dynamic network of blossoming and seasoned professionals, and of course, celebrating the wondrous experience that first brought us all together. Our team created this application to inspire a vision of what Galvanize Alumni Day might look like. 

Want to get a peak at the newest tech being taught at gSchool? 
Are you now a hot shot Senior Dev seeking new talent? 
Feeling stuck and needing to make a career pivot? 

gDay is the perfect way to reunite and stay connected with your very first colleagues and mentors in the industry!

This is an annual reunion for ALL graduates, cohorts, and members of the Galvanize community. 

## Problem statement:
    
Some of the first jewels of wisdom we received at Galvanize was the importance of attending Meetups, networking, and getting involved. Shouldn’t there be a way to stay connected with our immediate community of developers, a concerted effort to stay engaged with the individuals who share the not-so-common drive and experience that it takes to become a Galvanize alumnus?

## How will your project solve this problem?
    
Our application not only serves as the driver for the annual event, but it also allows graduates the ability to connect with each other leading up to gDay.

Our app also helps alumni stay up to date on relevant industry events and happenings with a curated list designed to cater to the Galvanize grads. With short graduate profiles and a calendar of alumni events, past gSchool students can connect in a fun and productive way.

## Map the user experience:

One of the fundamentals gStudents learn is that networking is the key to being successful in the tech industry.  The user would benefit from having a platform where they can connect or reconnect with gSchool Alumni.  When a Galvanize graduate visits the gDay app, they will find a simple way to create a profile, register for gDay, shop gSchool swag, and contact gSchool and their gSchool alumni.

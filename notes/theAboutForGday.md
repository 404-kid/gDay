# The Plan

With the gDay web application our team seeks to create a platform for bringing together gSchool alumni, instructors, and support staff for an annual two-day extravaganza — filled with tech talks, guest speakers, hackathons, product demos, workshops, a picnic and happy hours. Our team created this application to inspire a vision of what an official 'Galvanize Alumni Day' might look like.

## A Celebration

A big part of the Galvanize experience is about networking with your peers and being involved in the tech community. We want to continue that tradition, post-graduation by curating a chance to reconnect with friends, re-engage with our dynamic network of blossoming and seasoned professionals, and of course, celebrating the wondrous experience in which we all share.

## Be Inspired

gDay is more than a reunion. It’s a place to learn and grow professionally and be introduced to new concepts and technologies. Topics and workshops range from DevOps to UX/UI design, "what's new in tech", and more.

Event suggestions and general inquiries can be submitted via the community portal.

Sign up today and we'll see you soon at gDay 2019!
